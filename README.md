# dolt-db-skills

This repo develops and runs skills for managing the **BusMgmtBenchmarks** Dolt database — a financial data project tracking retail company financials from SEC 10-K filings and Yahoo Finance.

Skills are slash commands (e.g., `/analyze-financials`) installed into AI tools (Claude Code, Copilot, Gemini, etc.) from `.skillshare/skills/`.

## Available Skills

### `/analyze-financials TICKER YEAR`

**Purpose:** Fetch, compare, and reconcile financial data for a retail company across multiple sources (SEC 10-K, Yahoo Finance, and Dolt DB), then produce database-ready reconciled values.

**What it does:**
1. Looks up company metadata (CIK, display name) in the Dolt database
2. Fetches income statements and balance sheets from SEC 10-K filings and Yahoo Finance in parallel
3. Extracts 13 standard financial fields (Revenue, COGS, Gross Margin, SGA, Operating Profit, Net Profit, Inventory, Current Assets, Total Assets, Current Liabilities, Liabilities, Total Shareholder Equity, Total Liabilities & SE)
4. Runs automated anomaly detection (SGA composite rules, balance sheet mismatches, restatement checks)
5. Presents a side-by-side comparison table showing differences across sources
6. Recommends reconciled values with source attribution
7. Generates and saves a markdown report to `reports/{TICKER}-{YEAR}.md`

**Usage:** `/analyze-financials TRR 2024`

### `/insert-financials TICKER YEAR`

**Purpose:** Generate a SQL `REPLACE INTO` file containing reconciled financial data from `/analyze-financials`. This skill does NOT connect to or modify the database — it writes a `.sql` file that you apply manually.

**What it does:**
1. Collects reconciled values and metadata from the prior `/analyze-financials` run
2. Constructs a `REPLACE INTO financials` SQL statement with all 13 fields
3. Writes the SQL to `extract/2026/inserts/{TICKER}_{YEAR}_insert.sql`
4. Provides instructions for applying the SQL to your local Dolt clone

**Usage:** `/insert-financials TRR 2024` (after running `/analyze-financials TRR 2024` in the same session)

**Workflow:** Always run `/analyze-financials` first, review the analysis and reconciled values, then run `/insert-financials` to generate the insert file.

## Setup
